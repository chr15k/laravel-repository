Laravel Repository is a package for Laravel 7. It's used to abstract business logic into a repository layer.

The opinion...

Controllers should be light, human readable, and just control the flow.
Any developer should be able to take a look at a controller and understand it simply by reading it.

Models should be representation of the database schema and describes the relationships.
Models should just tell you what the data 'looks' like.

Repositories contain the business logic and any complex queries for your application.
They act as a wrapper for your models, giving human readable names to complicated queries.
